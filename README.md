# Guild Wars 2 API angular 1.5x

I've created this tool for better In-game achievements hunt since there is no way to filter achievements by reward type, and You can only see like 3 nearly finished achievements. Project is not completed, and I'm no longer doing it as I play much less nowadays.

You can test it at: http://projekt-gw2api.volmarg.hekko24.pl/
